# PROMPTS

**For this project, I mainly used ChatGPT as a technical assistant to quickly generate code snippets. I had the architecture and idea in mind, but it helped with boilerplate and specific implementations.**

_Hereâ€™s a list of prompts that I used:_

Generate controller and service layers for the product endpoints.

Create a product repository that reads data from a products.json file.

Set up a Swagger configuration file for API documentation.


Refactor controller and service code for clarity and simplicity.

Add error handling.

Format README.md and RUN.md for clarity.

Add example JSON data for testing.
