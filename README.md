# ðŸ›’ Meli-Challenge

A lightweight REST API built with **Spring Boot**.
It provides read-only access to product data stored locally in a JSON file â€” no database required.

---

##  Architecture Overview

The project follows a **simple layered architecture**, designed for clarity and maintainability:

* **Controller Layer** â†’ Handles HTTP requests and responses (`ProductController`).
* **Service Layer** â†’ Contains the business logic and coordinates data retrieval (`ProductService`).
* **Repository Layer** â†’ Reads and parses product data from a local JSON file (`ProductRepository`).
* **Domain Layer** â†’ Defines the `Product` model used across the application.

This structure keeps responsibilities separated and makes it easy to extend or replace components.

---

##  Features

* **Spring Boot 3 + Java 17**
* Products stored in **JSON** (no DB setup)
* Integrated **Swagger/OpenAPI** documentation
* Simple and fast to run with **Maven**
